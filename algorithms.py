# Prim's algorithm for finding an MST - 
#
# Input: An undirected, connected, weighted graph G.
# Output: T, a minimum spanning tree for G.
#
# T := âˆ….
# Pick any vertex in G and add it to T.
#
# For j = 1 to n-1
#       Let C be the set of edges with one endpoint inside T and one endpoint outside T.
#       Let e be a minimum weight edge in C.
#       Add e to T.
#       Add the endpoint of e not already in T to T.
# End-for
